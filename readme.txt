Twitter widget and shortcode to show your latest tweets one at a time an animated rotation

== Description ==
* **Replaces a [shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) such as `[rotatingtweets screen_name='your_twitter']`, or a [widget](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets), with a rotating display of your most recent tweets**
* **Supports v 1.1 of the API** - yes! it will keep working after March 2013
* **Space efficient** - instead of showing all your tweets at once, shows one at a time and then smoothly replaces it with the next one. After showing all your tweets, loops back to the beginning again.
* **Reliable** - keeps showing your latest Tweets even if the Twitter website is down.
* **Customisable** - you decide whose tweets to show, how many to show, whether to include retweets and replies, and whether to show a follow button. You can also decide how quickly the tweets rotate and what type of animation to use.
* Gives you the option to show a fully customisable Twitter 'follow' button
* Replaces [t.co](http://t.co) links with the original link
* Caches the most recent data from Twitter to avoid problems with rate limiting
* Uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [jQuery.Cycle](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/) to produce a nice smooth result.
* **Multi-lingual** - now set up to be multi-lingual. The Twitter 'follow' button is automatically translated to match your site's language setting [if Twitter has made the appropriate language available](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/help/languages). Also uses [Wordpress's multi-lingual capability](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers) to enable translation of all the other text used by the plug-in via language packs.

Currently the following languages are available:
* US English *(complete)*
* British English *(complete - mainly changing 'favorite' to 'favourite'!)*
* German *(basic tweet display only)*
* Spanish *(tweet display only)*
* Italian *(tweet display only)*
* Dutch *(tweet display only)*

If you have made the plug-in work in your language, please send the [gettext PO and MO files](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers) to [me](http://www.martintod.org.uk/contact-martin/) and I will then share them with everyone else. You can download [the latest POT file](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/rotatingtweets/trunk/languages/rotatingtweets.pot), and [PO files in each language](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/rotatingtweets/trunk/languages/) from this site. You may find [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/) rather useful for translation and creation of PO and MO files.

If you'd like to see what the plug-in looks like in action, you can [see the plug-in working here](http://www.martintod.org.uk/2012/05/29/new-twitter-plugin-to-show-tweets-in-rotation/).

== Installation ==
= Installation =
1. Upload the contents of `rotatingtweets.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the Wordpress installer
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the [My applications page](https://dev.twitter.com/apps) on the Twitter website to set up your website as a new Twitter 'application'. You may need to log-in using your Twitter user name and password.
1. If you don't already have a suitable 'application' to use for your website, set one up on the [Create an Application page](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new). It's normally best to use the name, description and website URL of the website where you plan to use Rotating Tweets. You don't need a Callback URL.
1. After clicking **Create your Twitter application**, on the following page, click on **Create my access token**.
1. Copy the **Consumer key**, **Consumer secret**, **Access token** and **Access token secret** from your Twitter application page into the Rotating Tweets settings page. Hit save. If there is a problem, you will see an error message.
1. Place a shortcode such `[rotatingtweets screen_name='mpntod']` in your post or page, or use a widget

= Set-up =
Options include:

1. Going to the Widgets menu on the admin page and adding the Rotating Tweets widget. Options include the name of the Twitter account to show, whether to show retweets and the speed of rotation.
1. Using the basic Rotating Tweets shortcode, for example `[rotatingtweets screen_name='mpntod']`
1. Using a more complicated Rotating Tweets shortcode, for example `[rotatingtweets screen_name='mpntod' include_rts='1' tweet_count='7' timeout='3000']`

= Variables =
Possible variables for the shortcode include:

* `screen_name` = Twitter user name - required
* `include_rts` = `'0'` or `'1'` - include retweets - optional - default is `'0'`
* `exclude_replies` = `'0'` or `'1'` - exclude replies - optional - default is `'0'`

* `timeout` = time that each tweet is shown in milliseconds - optional - default is `'4000'` (i.e. 4 seconds)
* `no_show_count` = `'0'` or `'1'` - remove the follower count from the Twitter follow button - optional - default is `'0'`
* `no_show_screen_name` = `'0'` or `'1'` - remove the screen name from the Twitter follow button - optional - default is `'0'`
* `show_meta_timestamp` = `'0'` or `'1'` - show the time and date of each tweet - optional - default is `'1'`
* `show_meta_screen_name` = `'0'` or `'1'` - show who posted each tweet - optional - default is `'1'`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How often does the plug-in call Twitter =
In most cases, each use (or "instance") of this plug-in gets data from Twitter every 2 minutes. The exception is when two or more instances share the same settings (screen name etc.), in which case they share the same data rather than each calling it separately.

= How can I add a Twitter bird to the left of my tweets? =
You can do this by going to the `rotatingtweets/css` directory and renaming `yourstyle-sample.css` to `yourstyle.css`.  This displays a Twitter bird to the left of your tweets.  Any CSS you put into `yourstyle.css` won't be overwritten when the plug-in is upgraded to the latest version.

= The Rotating Tweets are not rotating. What can I do? =
This normally happens if there is more than one copy of jQuery installed on a page - or more than one copy of jQuery.cycle.

To see if this is the case, you can search the HTML on your website to see if either script is called more than once.  The quickest way is to search the page for `jquery` and look out for lines that contain `jquery.min.js` or `jquery.cycle.all.min.js`.

The problem is that the second (or third) copy of the script overwrites all previous versions and the scripts that go with them.  This is particularly likely to happen with old templates or plug-ins.

If this is the case, the first thing to check is that you have upgraded your template or your plug-in to the latest version.
