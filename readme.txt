Displays animated rotation of latest tweets on a Twitter account via widget or shortcode such as [rotatingtweets screen_name='your_name']

== Description ==
* Replaces a [shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) such as `[rotatingtweets screen_name='your_twitter_name']`, or a [widget](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets), with a rotating display of your most recent tweets
* Space efficient - instead of showing all your tweets at once, shows one at a time and then smoothly replaces it with the next one. After showing all your tweets, loops back to the beginning again.
* Reliable - keeps showing your latest Tweets even if the Twitter website is down.
* Customisable - you decide whose tweets to show, how many to show, whether to include retweets and replies, and whether to show a follow button. You can also decide how quickly the tweets rotate.
* Replaces [t.co](http://t.co) links with the original link
* Caches the most recent data from Twitter to avoid problems with rate limiting
* Uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [jQuery.Cycle](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/) to produce a nice smooth result.

If you'd like to see what it looks like in action, you can [see the plug-in working here](http://www.martintod.org.uk/2012/05/29/new-twitter-plugin-to-show-tweets-in-rotation/).
== Installation ==
1. Upload the contents of `rotatingtweets.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the Wordpress installer
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place a shortcode such `[rotatingtweets screen_name='mpntod']` in your post or page, or use a widget

Possible variables for the shortcode include:

* `screen_name` = Twitter user name - required
* `include_rts` = `'0'` or `'1'` - include retweets - optional - default is `'0'`
* `exclude_replies` = `'0'` or `'1'` - exclude replies - optional - default is `'0'`
* `tweet_count` = number of tweets to show - optional - default is `5`
* `show_follow` = `'0'` or `'1'` - show follow button - optional - default is `'0'`
* `timeout` = time that each tweet is shown in milliseconds - optional - default is `'4000'` (i.e. 4 seconds)

But you may just decide to use the 'Rotating Tweets' widget!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How often does the plug-in call Twitter =
In most cases, each use (or "instance") of this plug-in gets data from Twitter every 2 minutes. The exception is when two or more instances share the same settings (screen name etc.), in which case they share the same data rather than each calling it separately.
